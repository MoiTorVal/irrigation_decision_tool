            1.1 Service Description
          </h3>
          <p>
            WaterStress is the owner and provider of a cloud-based water stress
            monitoring and irrigation decision support platform (the
            &quot;Service&quot;). The Service ingests publicly available weather
            and evapotranspiration data, field configurations, crop parameters,
            and optional sensor telemetry to compute soil water balance models,
            generate irrigation scheduling recommendations, and produce water
            stress forecasts. Anything Customer (including Users) posts,
            uploads, shares, stores, or otherwise provides through the Service
            is considered a &quot;User Submission.&quot; Customer is solely
            responsible for all User Submissions it contributes to the Service.
            Further terms regarding User Submissions, including ownership, are
            in Section 9.2 below. The Service may also include templates, help
            documents, agronomic reference materials, and other documents or
            information that can assist Customer in using the Service
            (&quot;WaterStress Content&quot;). Customer will not receive or have
            access to the code or software that underlies the Service
            (collectively the &quot;Software&quot;) or receive a copy of the
            Software itself.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-surface">
            1.2 Customer&apos;s Subscription
          </h3>
          <p>
            Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Customer may purchase a
            subscription to, and has the right to access and use, the Service as
            specified in one or more ordering screens agreed to by the parties
            through WaterStress&apos;s website that reference this Agreement and
            describe the business terms related to Customer&apos;s subscription
            (&quot;Order(s)&quot;). All subscriptions will be for the period
            described on the applicable Order (&quot;Subscription Period&quot;).
            Use of and access to the Service is permitted only by individuals
            authorized by Customer and for Customer&apos;s own internal business
            purposes and not for the benefit of any third party
            (&quot;Users&quot;).

            1.3 WaterStress&apos;s Ownership
          </h3>
          <p>
            WaterStress owns the Service, Software, WaterStress Content,
            Documentation, and anything else provided by WaterStress to Customer
            (collectively the &quot;WaterStress Materials&quot;). WaterStress
            retains all right, title, and interest (including, without
            limitation, all patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, and
            other intellectual property rights) in and to the WaterStress
            Materials, all related and underlying technology and any updates,
            enhancements, upgrades, modifications, patches, workarounds, and
            fixes thereto and all derivative works of or modifications to any of
            the foregoing. There are no implied licenses under this Agreement
            and any rights not expressly granted to Customer in this Agreement
            are expressly reserved by WaterStress.

            1.4 Agronomic Disclaimer
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Service provides irrigation scheduling recommendations and water
            stress forecasts based on mathematical models (including the FAO-56
            soil water balance methodology), publicly available weather data,
            and information provided by Customer. These outputs are
            decision-support tools and do not constitute professional agronomic
            advice. Customer acknowledges that actual field conditions may
            differ from modeled conditions and that WaterStress does not
            guarantee crop outcomes, yields, or water savings. Customer is
            solely responsible for all irrigation decisions made using the
            Service.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-surface">1.5 Permissions</h3>
          <p>
            {" "}
            13:42 [420/1980] The Service contains customizable settings allowing
            each User to give permission to other Users to perform various tasks
            within the Service (&quot;Permissions&quot;). It is solely
            Customer&apos;s responsibility to set and manage all Permissions,
            including which Users can set such Permissions. Accordingly,
            WaterStress will have no responsibility for managing Permissions and
            no liability for the Permissions set by Customer and its Users.
            Customer may, at its option, provide access to the Service and
            Documentation to its Affiliates, in which case all rights granted,
            and obligations incurred, under this Agreement will also inure to
            the benefit of such Affiliates. Customer represents and warrants
            that it is fully responsible for any breach of this Agreement by its
            Affiliates and that Customer has the power to negotiate this
            Agreement on behalf of its Affiliates. Customer will also be
            responsible for all payment obligations under this Agreement
            regardless of whether the use of the Service is by Customer or its
            Affiliates. Any claim by an Affiliate against WaterStress will be
            brought by Customer and not the Affiliate. For the purposes of this
            Agreement &quot;Affiliate&quot; will mean an entity directly or
            indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
            that party (where &quot;control&quot; means the ownership or
            control, directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of
            all the voting power of the shares (or other securities or rights)
            entitled to vote for the election of directors or other governing
            authority).

            access Customer&apos;s account by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
            Service itself. Customer will ensure that its Users are aware of and
            bound by obligations and/or restrictions stated in this Agreement

            The Service may work together with third-party products, services,
            or applications that are not owned or controlled by WaterStress
            (e.g., CIMIS, weather data providers, sensor hardware platforms,

            information to WaterStress for the sole purpose of WaterStress
            providing the Service to Customer, and Customer represents and

          <p>
            Customer will pay for access to and use of the Service as set forth
            on the applicable Order (&quot;Fees&quot;). All Fees will be paid in
            the currency stated in the applicable Order or, if no currency is
            specified, U.S. dollars. Payment obligations are non-cancelable and,
            except as expressly stated in this Agreement, non-refundable.
            WaterStress may modify its Fees or introduce new fees in its sole
            discretion. Customer always has the right to choose not to renew its
            subscription if it does not agree with any new or revised Fees.
          </p>
          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-surface">4.2 Payment</h3>
          <p>
            WaterStress, either directly or through its third-party payment
            processor (&quot;Payment Processor&quot;), will charge Customer for
            the Fees via credit card or ACH payment, pursuant to the payment
            information provided by Customer. WaterStress will have the right to
            charge Customer&apos;s payment method for any services provided
            under the Order, including recurring Fees. It is Customer&apos;s
            sole responsibility to provide WaterStress with current and
            up-to-date payment information; failure to provide such information
            may result in suspension of Customer&apos;s access to the Service.
            If Customer pays the Fees through a Payment Processor, such payment
            processing will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy
            policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement.
            WaterStress is not responsible for any error by, or other acts or
            omissions of, the Payment Processor. WaterStress reserves the right
            to correct any errors or mistakes that the Payment Processor makes
            even if WaterStress has already requested or received payment.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-medium text-surface">4.3 Taxes</h3>

            value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any
            jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, &quot;Taxes&quot;). Customer
            is responsible for paying all Taxes associated with its purchases
            hereunder. If WaterStress has the legal obligation to pay or collect
            Taxes for which Customer is responsible under this section,
            WaterStress will invoice Customer and Customer will pay that amount
            unless Customer provides WaterStress with a valid tax exemption
            certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority in
            advance. For clarity, WaterStress is solely responsible for taxes
            assessable against it based on its income, property, and employees.

            Customer&apos;s access to the Service pending payment of such
            overdue amounts. Customer also authorizes WaterStress to make
            multiple re-attempts at charging Customer&apos;s payment instrument

          <p>
            If Customer terminates this Agreement because of WaterStress&apos;s
            uncured breach, WaterStress will refund any unused, prepaid Fees for
            the remainder of the then-current Subscription Period. If
            WaterStress terminates this Agreement because of Customer&apos;s
            uncured breach, Customer will pay any unpaid Fees covering the
            remainder of the then-current Subscription Period after the
            effective date of termination. In no event will any termination
            relieve Customer of the obligation to pay any Fees payable to
            WaterStress for the period prior to the effective date of
            termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, all rights and
            licenses granted by WaterStress hereunder will immediately
            terminate; Customer will no longer have the right to access or use
            the Service. Within thirty (30) days of termination, upon
            Customer&apos;s request, WaterStress will delete Customer&apos;s
            User Information, including passwords and all related information,
            files, User Submissions, and field data, unless Customer requests an
            earlier deletion in writing. WaterStress may delete all User
            Submissions or User Information if Customer maintains an account in
            the Free Version but such account is not used for a period of one
            (1) year or more.

            a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the
            provision will be modified by the court and interpreted so as best
            to accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the
            fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of
            this Agreement will remain in effect.
